## Introduction to .NET

Let's review what .NET is.

### History of .NET

Microsoft's .NET was created as a support framework for programmers to 
allow them to build applications quickly, without having to worry about
the underlying functionality.

Containing a rich collection of prebuilt component libraries, .NET
supports development across many languages, including C#, Visual Basic,
and F#.

The .NET Framework was first released in 2002, as a framework on which
to develop applications and libraries for Windows only.

The introduction of .NET Core in 2016 permitted application development
across multiple platforms, including Windows, Linux, and macOS.

.NET Standard is the library to target when developing using resources
from both .NET Framework and .NET Core.

Starting from .NET 5, the "Core" name was removed.

Although a few newer versions have been released, we will focus on
.NET 6 for this training course. Don't worry. The programming concepts 
remain valid in .NET 7, 8, and 9.

### Open Source .NET

Although it used to be closed source, .NET is now open source and is
available on GitHub.

According to Microsoft:

> All aspects of .NET are open source including class libraries, 
> runtime, compilers, languages, ASP.NET Core web framework, Windows 
> desktop frameworks, and Entity Framework Core data access library, 
> and more.
>
> [.NET on GitHub](https://github.com/dotnet)

The open source .NET repositories are maintained by the
[.NET Foundation](https://dotnetfoundation.org)
