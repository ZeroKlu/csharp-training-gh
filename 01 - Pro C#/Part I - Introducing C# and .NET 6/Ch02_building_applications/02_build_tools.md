## .NET Build Tools

There are many alternatives for developing and building .NET 
applications. In our training, we will look at two alternatives:

1. Visual Studio
2. Visual Studio Code

### Visual Studio

If you followed the setup guide
[Setting Up Your Workstation for C# and 
Unity API Training](../../../00%20-%20Resources/Setup%20Documents/01%20Setting%20Up%20Your%20Workstation%20for%20Development%20Training.md), you have already installed Visual Studio. If not, you should 
do so now.

> Licensing Note: If you are only licensed for Visual Studio Community
> Edition, you should not use Visual Studio to build software for which
> you (or your employer) are paid. You will require either a 
> Professional or Enterprise license in order to develop commercial
> software.

### Visual Studio Code

If you followed the setup guide
[Setting Up Your Workstation for Development Training](../../../00%20-%20Resources/Setup%20Documents/01%20Setting%20Up%20Your%20Workstation%20for%20Development%20Training.md), you have already installed Visual Studio Code. If not, you should 
do so now.

> In order to use VS Code to develop and build .NET applications, you
> will need to have Visual Studio licensed. The same rules apply to
> code built in VS Code as they do in Visual Studio vis-a-vis 
> commercial delivery.
