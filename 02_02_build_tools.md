## .NET Build Tools

There are many alternatives for developing and building .NET 
applications. In our training, we will look at two alternatives:

1. Visual Studio
2. Visual Studio Code

### Visual Studio

If you followed the setup guide
[Setting Up Your Workstation for C# and 
Unity API Training](../../../00%20-%20Resources/Setup%20Documents/01%20Setting%20Up%20Your%20Workstation%20for%20Development%20Training.md),
you have already installed Visual Studio. If not, you should do so now.

> Licensing Note: If you are only licensed for Visual Studio Community
> Edition, you should not use Visual Studio to build software for which
> you (or your employer) are paid. You will require either a 
> Professional or Enterprise license in order to develop commercial
> software.

### Visual Studio Code

If you followed the setup guide
[Setting Up Your Workstation for Development Training](../../../00%20-%20Resources/Setup%20Documents/01%20Setting%20Up%20Your%20Workstation%20for%20Development%20Training.md), you have already installed Visual Studio Code. If not, you should 
do so now.

> In order to use VS Code to develop and build .NET applications, you
> will need to have Visual Studio licensed. The same rules apply to
> code built in VS Code as they do in Visual Studio vis-a-vis 
> commercial delivery.

* Community Edition (free):
    * Intended for students, hobbyists, and non-commercial software
      development.
    * Does not include advanced testing and code analysis tools.
    * If developing for-profit software, this is supported only for
      open-source projects and organizations with fewer than 5 employees.
    * This is sufficient fo this training course.
* Professional ($100/mo per developer):
    * Same feature pack as Community Edition.
    * Includes advanced testing and code analysis tools.
    * Supports for-profit software development.
    * I purchase this license personally for my own non-company projects.
* Enterprise ($500/mo per developer):
    * In addition to the Professional feature set, this includes:
        * Dependency validation
        * Architecture diagramming
        * Architecture validation
        * Code cloning and conversion
        * Memory dump analysis
        * Tracing
        * Unit & load testing
        * Licenses for servers and software for testing VMs
    * This license is what it used by my team.
